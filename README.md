# The Contacto Material Style Guide

This is a comprehensive collection of all UI components that are used in the contacto console application. This is developed based on the [style guide](https://www.figma.com/file/Qbo6JU64XtTjo6npGWdX2z/Contacto-Style-Guide?node-id=217%3A106) provided by the design team. These components can be further extended into other apps by just modifying the CSS variable list. This collection almost has all
required components to build a standard application. On each component you will find different stories, which are different states of the UI component.
Buliding them here makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. These **stories** are different states of a component which can be independantly developed and tested and finally consumed without flaws.

## How to use?

1. Install the component package `npm install @contacto-io/style-guide`
2. Add `@import "~@contacto-io/material-style-guide/build/style-guide.css";` to your main CSS file (Eg. App.scss)
3. Import the component that is required - ```import { Button } from '@contacto-io/style-guide'```
4. Visit the particular component page on the storybook app.
5. Navigate to your required story.
6. Copy the code and modify the `props` as required.
7. Since all the components are wrapper components upon Material UI, please visit [material docs](https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/) for additional information.

## Technical Requirements

#### Icons

The icons used are taken from the google icon package. We use Material Rounded Icons throughout our App. For icon names, please visit [Google Material Icon Website](https://fonts.google.com/icons)

## Dev Setup
- Make sure you have the .npmrc file with the proper access credentials. You need to have a token that has read/publish package access
  ```
  //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken=YOUR_GIT_TOKEN_WITH_READ_PUBLISH_PACKAGE_ACCESS
  ```
- To run the setup locally use `npm run storybook`

### Publishing
- Once your changes are done
- Bump the version number in `package.json` (important)
- Run `npm run build`
- In order to publish use `npm publish` command. This will only work if you have write access in your git token
